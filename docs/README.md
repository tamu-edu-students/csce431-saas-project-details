# CSCE 606 SaaS Projects

## Client Expectations

The client for a CSCE 606 (Software Engineering) project serves a vital role for the course and the students.

### Clients are expected to...

* Meet with the development team periodically (at least once every two weeks) to
  + identify the functions that the system should perform.
  + sketch out a user interface and develop a "storyboard" of how the interface works.
  + try out the software.
  + provide feedback on prioritizing additional features.
  + create, review, and revise as needed a schedule of milestones (what features when)
* Participate in requirements engineering at the beginning of the project (discussing what you want)
* Participate in verification and validation at the end (discussing what you got).
* Provide a final evaluation of the project, which will be used to provide feedback to the instructional team.
* Treat the team members with respect.

### Clients should expect...

* To be contacted by the team within 1 week of project assignment.
* The team to schedule regular meetings (at least once every two weeks).
* The team (or its representative(s)) to come to meetings prepared with updated user stories and interface mock-ups, as well as a demonstration of the features that have been completed since the last meeting.
* Very little obvious progress to be made in the first 2 - 4 weeks (1 - 2 sprints).  Students are learning the language and the frameworks while they work.  The team will become **much** more productive later.
* The service to look very plain for the first 10 weeks.  The focus is on functionality, not aesthetics. "No amount of pretty can make up for broken."
* A minimum viable product (MVP) to be completed at the end of each 2-week sprint. The MVP should have just enough features to be usable in order to gather feedback for future product development.
* Team members to be respectful and professional.

## Project Expectations

These are the basic criteria I use when evaluating a project for fitness as a 606 project.

The software must have:

* Users of at least 2 different kinds with different levels of access and views of the data
* Requires data persistence and dynamic updating of data
* Significant control logic (i.e. does meaningful and non-trivial computation)
* A browser-based / web front-end (no desktop or mobile-native apps)
* Enough features for a team of 7 +/- 2 students to spend several weeks implementing (be "big")
* Not too many or too complex of features (but not "too big")
* Value for the client such that the client could potentially use it
